It's called the Circle of fifths. Here's a picture what it looks like : If C is chosen as a starting point, the sequence is: C, G, D, A, E, B (=C\u266d), F\u266f (=G\u266d), C\u266f (=D\u266d), A\u266d, E\u266d, B\u266d, F. The circle of fifths organizes pitches in a sequence of perfect fifths, generally shown as a circle with the pitches (and their corresponding keys) in a clockwise progression. Musicians and composers often use the circle of fifths to describe the musical relationships between pitches. Its design is helpful in composing and harmonizing melodies, building chords, and modulating to different keys within a composition.
