**Great first impression**

Point out with a progressive layout. Give decision makers and HR only the most important information about you on one single page.

**Beginner friendly**

Pick a template, replace the content, compile, done. If that's not enough you can easily customize colors, fonts and layout. The templates are documented directly in the code. 

**Minimal environment**

You need a minimal tex-live distribution to compile the templates. No XeTeX or LuaTeX required. No other SDKs or environments required.

## How to build?

The following guide just briefly describes the requirements and build procedure as there are many ways to install a LaTeX distribution on various OS. Please create an issue, if this part is not helpful.

**Build Requirements**

You will need some minimal Texlive distrubution (The full texlive distribution is nearly 2GB large but you will need only a part of it). A good starting point is here: https://www.latex-project.org/get/#tex-distributions

If you want to install texlive from tug.org instead, you can use this guide: https://tug.org/texlive/

Users of various Linux distrubutions can also install texlive from their repositories.

This repo also contains a `texlive.profile` file in the project root, that can be used to install the minimum required texlive packages when manually installing texlive.


**Build Procedure**


 * Clone or download this project. 
 * Change to a template folder, which contains a `main.tex` file do
 * Edit the `main.tex` according to your CV credentials, optionally change settings and colors etc.
 * Run `pdflatex` (build/compile) 
 - The `main.pdf` should show the output.
