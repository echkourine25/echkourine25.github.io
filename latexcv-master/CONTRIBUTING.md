# Contributing

Everyone is welcome to open a pull request and improve this package. To maximize the chance to make the PR become accepted, please consider the following guidelines.

### Structure

* Each template should have in its own directory
* A template should always consist of a `main.tex` file and should only be extended, if the code extends the complexity of a single file (e.g. more than 1000 lines).
* Included `.tex` files should be stored in a folder, e.g. named "lib" (for structural docs) or "g" (for tikz graphics).
* Non-compiling PRs will be rejected
* Always add the main.pdf output as a
* Make sure, that your PR does not cause a template to exceed the size of one page. This project intends to keep every template short and clear.

### Dependencies

* There are currently only `tex-live` and `tex-live fonts` as dependencies and most of even complex operations can be implemented (see inforgraphics template). Therefore creating a new package dependecy may defy the goal of being simple to install and compile.
* Solutions using Xetex and Luatax as well as Komascript and others will therefore not be included
* No interdependencies between templates, please. 

I know this creates lots of duplicate code or make it harde to solve a feature request,  but there is a clear intention behind this: Users and especially those who are new to LaTeX should have a quick editable, easy to understand and easy to compile template to create their own cv. Therefore each cv should be viewed as a single instance. In the future there may be an enhancement to define the personal credentials in a single file and include it in each cv template.


### Code

* Comments should be added as often as possible. Please see the modern or infographics template for orientation.
* Greater sections should be introduced with a block-sized comment. Please see the modern or infographics template for orientation.
* Please comment parameters. If a parameter is not commented yet and the command is therefore not understandable, please open an issue.
