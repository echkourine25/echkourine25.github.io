<p>Hey, there today I present you a new game called Idle Research
Out on August 1 2022 it’s almost recent.</p>

<p>I’m always looking for new games, new concepts etc … 
I tried a tycoon market game that was funny for a moment but not enough good to make a post for it. And it is a bit pay 2 win.</p>

<p>It was my first incremental game then a made a couple of research and find some incremental games that i tried but nothing exceptionnal.</p>

<p>And then I found Idle Research.</p>

<p>This game is butifull have a decent game time perdiod etheir i do not finished it cause it bore me a bit now. Wanna look for something new.</p>

<p>In Iddle research you craft flask of different colors. You start with red flask. Each flask you have make energy per second that you can spend to unlock something.
Once you have enough red flask you can craft orange wich is made of red flask. And it increse the power of red flasks.</p>

<p>When you go a bit further you unlock awesome capacity like auto crafting and automation mechanism.</p>

<p>Then you unlock fire flask, fuel flask, gold flask and ice flask. Wich are specific flask and have too be crafted a different way.</p>

<p>For exemple gold flask are earned by resetting the game. But when you do this you gain some multiplicators on crafting speed then comes automation.</p>

<p>After this comes tubes but i only unlocked ice flask so can’t tell you much more about the game.</p>

<p>Have a look it’s free and available on iOS, Android, web, and Steam.</p>
